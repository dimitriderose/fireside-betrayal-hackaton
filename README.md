# 🔥 Fireside: Betrayal

**The AI is one of you. Trust no one.**

A real-time, voice-first multiplayer social deduction game where an AI narrator leads players through an immersive story — and one of the characters is secretly controlled by AI.

## What is this?

Fireside: Betrayal combines the narrative immersion of tabletop RPGs with the social tension of Werewolf/Mafia. An AI narrator runs the game while simultaneously playing as a hidden character, lying, manipulating, and fighting to survive.

- 🎭 **3–8 players** — 2–7 humans + 1 hidden AI character
- 🎙️ **Voice-first** — the AI narrates with dramatic flair, players speak through their phone mic and interrupt naturally
- 🐺 **Hidden AI player** — one character is secretly the AI, with its own deception strategy
- 🎲 **Random AI alignment** — the AI might be friend or foe (Normal/Hard difficulty)
- 🧠 **Post-game reveal** — see exactly what the AI was thinking every round
- 🎭 **8 unique roles** — Villager, Seer, Healer, Hunter, Drunk, Bodyguard, Tanner, Shapeshifter
- 🎤 **4 narrator presets** — Classic, Campfire, Horror, Comedy — each with distinct voice and tone
- ⏱️ **15–30 minutes** per game
- 📱 **No download** — works in any mobile browser

## How it plays

1. **Gather around the fire** — Share a 6-character join code. Everyone joins on their phone.
2. **Pick a narrator** — Choose from Classic, Campfire, Horror, or Comedy narration styles. Preview each voice before starting.
3. **Roles are dealt** — Villager, Seer, Healer, Hunter, Bodyguard, Tanner... and the AI hides among you (or plays as a loyal ally — you won't know).
4. **Night falls, dawn breaks** — The Shapeshifter hunts. The Seer investigates. The Bodyguard protects. The village debates and votes.
5. **Speak up or stay silent** — Talk into your mic during discussions. The narrator hears you, identifies your character, and relays your points to the village. A countdown timer keeps debates moving.
6. **The truth is revealed** — After the game, see the AI's hidden reasoning for every lie it told, listen to audio highlights, and share your results.
